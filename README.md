vim-gains-nrepl
===============

This has been intended to be a simple way to talk to nrepl from Vim. I've almost succeed - the only excess here is nREPL sessions support, it enables ClojureScript support. See [plugin docs](doc/vim-gains-nrepl.txt) for details.

You need Vim with Python support to use this.
